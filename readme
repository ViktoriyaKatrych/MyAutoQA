This repozitory was created during studying on Tester QA Auto Course on the Prometheus platform 
https://prometheus.org.ua/prometheus-plus/automatic-software-testing/

There are API test, UI test, HTTP test and Database test exercises.

This code was developed by Viktoriya Katrych base on course materials.
You can use this code, it's free :)))
